A machine learning project that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave a service) based on their behavior, demographic, and service usage data.
The goal is to help businesses identify at-risk customers early and take proactive retention measures.
This project uses supervised learning techniques to classify customers as likely to churn or not churn.
It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and training multiple machine learning models to compare their performance.
